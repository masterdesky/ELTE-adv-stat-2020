    "100 people are given a standard antibiotic to treat an infection and another 100 are given a new antibiotic. In the first group, 90 people recover; in the second group, 85 people recover. Let \\\\(p_1\\\\) be the probability of recovery under the standard treatment and let \\\\(p_2\\\\) be the probability of recovery under the new treatment. We are interested in estimating \\\\(\\theta = p_1 - p_2\\\\) . Provide an estimate, the (estimated) standard error, and the (approximate) 80 percent confidence interval for \\\\(\\theta\\\\)."
