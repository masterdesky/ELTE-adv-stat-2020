    "We shall study systems, whose time evolution for short time is uniquely determined. It can be given by a set of differential equations or functions describing the change from one time step to the next one. These are called deterministic dynamical systems. Many of them show regular motion (periodic motion or composition of periodic motions), e.g. the motion of a planet, oscillators with linear coupling, vibrations of a solid.\n",
    "Many others show irregular motion, which seems to be random at least on a large time-scale: the Galton Board, irregular motion of gas particles or Brownian motion in a fluid etc.\n",
    "At this point we can say the behavior is called chaotic, if it is totally deterministic (which is seen in the short time scale), but is irregular, random-like for long time scale.\n",
    "Exact definition will be given later.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last examples are related to the foundation of statistical physics. As usually, we represent the state of the system by a point in the phase space. As it follows the change of the state of the system a trajectory is formed. Theorems of statistical physics assume a closed system with many degrees of freedom behaves such that the point in the phase space visits uniformly the energy shell when followed for long time. By energy shall we can think of a region whose points correspond to energies between $E$ and $E+\\delta E$ with a sufficiently small $\\delta E$. The trajectory visits it uniformly in the sense, that the time it spends in a certain region of the energy surface is proportional to the corresponding volume of the energy shell. Consequently, the average of a function $f(\\mathbf{p}, \\mathbf{q})$ for a long time period can be approximated by the space average of $f$ in the energy shell.\n",

It is general, continuously present in every chaotic systems, both in conservative and dissipative ones. It is even observable in the forthcoming 1D maps, which apply a simplified descriptioin of higher dimensional chaotic systems. More uniquely will be seen this mechanism in baker's map, see later."
