Dear Students,

I can help via chat and call during the today course time from about 11:30 till 14:00.
I will be available by google hangouts ( account kaufmann66 ),
in microsoft teams ( kaufmann.zoltan@ttk.elte.hu ),
and by email ( kaufmann@complex.elte.hu ).
You can also ask questions any time later, but it is not sure I can respond at once. I try to answer as soon as possible and suggest a time for audio call if that is more convenient than simple chat.

Best Regards

Zolt√°n Kaufmann
